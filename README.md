# JavaScript-Projects
Hello, and welcome to my repository with a few examples of projects I worked on using JavaScript
## Projects
- Calculator
- Pizza Menu
- Tic-Tac-Toe

## Calulator
This is a basic 4-function, web-based calculator for users to add, subtract, multiply and divide!
## [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20JavaScript%20Projects/Pizza_Project)
This project is an electronic menu where you can choose the size of the pizza and the kind of toppings you like. 
After placing your order, a receipt is displayed showing you an itemized list and your total.
## [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/BrooksRadtke/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Basic%20JavaScript%20Projects/TicTacToe)
Classic tic-tac-toe with Legend of Zelda themes! A random roll decides who will go first, you or the computer,
then off you go to show your battle of wit! Background audio is included, as well as completed move confirmation,
win state and tie state. Enjoy!
